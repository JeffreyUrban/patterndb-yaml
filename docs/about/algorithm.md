# How patterndb-yaml Works

A detailed look at the algorithm behind processor.

## Core Algorithm

patterndb-yaml uses placeholder.

### The Process

1. **placeholder** placeholder

## Key Concepts

### placeholder

## Memory Efficiency

### placeholder

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity

- **placeholder**: O(placeholder)

### Space Complexity

- **placeholder**: O(placeholder)

## Oracle Compatibility

patterndb-yaml's algorithm is validated against an **oracle implementation** - a simple, obviously-correct but slower reference implementation.

All edge cases and complex scenarios are verified to match oracle behavior exactly.
